                Relaxing the Body <br>
                1. Find a time and a place to do this exercise so that you will not be interrupted. <br>
                2. Do not start if you are already stressed, have other matters distracting you, have drunk alcohol, used recreational drugs, or are tired.<br>
                3. Before beginning sit for a few minutes and just relax. Think of what you wish to accomplish with this exercise. Define your intention. <br>
                4. Now close your eyes.<br>
                5. Begin by taking three deep breaths in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. Repeat until you get used to this type of breathing so that the breathing itself is not distracting you.<br>
                6. Once you feel comfortable breathing in this manner, specifically think about how you are sitting and imagine that you are looking at yourself.<br>
                7. Now begin focusing on your toes and relax them. Now focus on your feet, relaxing your muscles. Imagine them almost melting away as you continue to breathe in and out. Only focus on your toes and feet. When you begin, it will be easy to be distracted or to have your thoughts wander. When this happens, simply begin again, relaxing the muscles of your toes and feet.<br>
                8. Once you have been able to relax your toes and feet, extend the exercise upward, relaxing your calves and thighs. <br>
                9. Then relax the muscles of your abdomen and chest.<br>
                10. Next think of your spine and relax the muscles all along your spine and up to your shoulders and your neck.<br>
                11. Finally relax the muscles of your face and your scalp.<br>
                12. As you are able to extend the relaxation of the muscles of your body, notice that there is a calmness overcoming you. That you feel good. At this point, it is not unusual to feel sleepy or even fall asleep. That’s OK. It may take several attempts to get to this point and be able to hold this feeling of being relaxed without falling asleep. Be patient. Be kind to yourself. <br>
                13. Now focus on your heart and think of relaxing your heart muscle as you slowly breathe in and out. You will find that your heartbeat will slow as your body relaxes and your breath slows.<br>
                14. Imagine your body, now completely relaxed, and experience the sense of simply being as you slowly breathe in and out. Feel the sense of warmth. Many will feel that they are floating and will be overcome with a sense of calmness. Continue to slowly breathe in and slowly exhale out.<br>
                15. With intention remember this sense of relaxation, calmness, and warmth.<br>
                16. Now slowly open your eyes. Sit for a few minutes with your eyes open and just be with no other intention or thought. Breath and relaxation are the first steps toward taming the mind.
